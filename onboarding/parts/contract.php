            <h2>The Contract</h2>
            Thank you for providing all the documentation in the steps before. You are now ready to sign the financial contract with us.<br />
            The following contract must be signed by an Authorized signer of the company.<br />
            The contract is in two parts:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>The Agreement</b>:<br />
                    The first e-mail you receive is the Agreement itself, it contains the fees, settlement terms and what we have registed on you as a customer. This is used as our shared documentation on what the actual agreement betwen us is.
                </li>
                <li><b>The POA</b>:<br />
                    The second e-mail you receive is the POA. A POA is a contract giving us the authority to enable the financial agreement between you and the financial institute.<br />
                    You need to sign both e-mails before the onboarding-flow have been fully completed.
                </li>
            </ol>
