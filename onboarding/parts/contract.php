        <h2>The Contract</h2>
        Thanks you for providing all the documentation in the steps before. You are now ready to sign the financial contract with us.<br />
        The contract is in two parts:
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>The Agreement</b>:<br />
                The first e-mail you receive is the Agreement itself, it contains the fees, settlement terms and what we have registed on you as a customer. This is used as our shared documentation on what the actual agreement betwen us is.
            </li>
            <li><b>The POA</b>:<br />
                The second e-mail you receive is the POA. A POA is a contract giving us the authority to enable the financial agreement between you and the financial institute.<br />
                You need to sign both e-mails before the onboarding-flow have been fully completed.
            </li>
        </ol>
